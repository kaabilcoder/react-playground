# 🚀 React-playground

A personal React learning repository filled with mini-projects, experiments, and hands-on components. This playground is my journey of mastering React through building and breaking things — and learning better by doing.

> 💡 _"Code is never truly learned until it's built."_ — This repo is all about that.

## 📚 About

**React-playground** is a growing collection of self-built mini React apps and components, aimed at improving my skills in:

- React fundamentals
- Hooks & State Management
- Component architecture
- Routing (React Router)
- TypeScript in React
- Reusable UI components
- Animations and UI polish
- Best practices & clean code

Each project or component is isolated inside its own folder, making it easy to explore and test individually.
